RioEngine
=========

Rio Engine is my own 3D Game Engine. Having worked in the game industry for two years, I was always enthusiastic about the different game engines that I had to work with, especially those that integrate a visual level editor. I always felt curious about how certain features are implemented, e.g. How does the engine recognize which object was picked by the user?, How does the engine display 3D models from a COLLADA scene? I have worked with this project using my free time for +1300 hours (2012-2015), and I have learned a lot with it! 

 Since I do not have plans to release a stable version (due to the lack of time) I have decided to release the source code under the public domain, this way I might be able to help other developers. 

 Please notice that the current version is still experimental (v0.1). If you want to create your own video games and you do not have any experience yet, I suggest you start using Unity3D http://unity3d.com/
